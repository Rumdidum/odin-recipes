    <h2>Good to know:</h2>
    <p>The distance between heaven and earth is sometimes not that great, at least from a culinary point of view. Sweet
    applesauce and fluffy mashed potatoes are called “Himmel un Ääd” on the plate in the Rhineland. There is of course
    "Flönz" - seared blood sausage.
