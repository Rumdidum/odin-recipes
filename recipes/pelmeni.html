    <h2>Good to know:</h2>
    <p><strong>Pelmeni</strong> are dumplings of Russian cuisine that consist of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened dough.
    
    The debate about the exact place of origin is still active, with Ural and Siberia both maintaining strong claims.
    Pelmeni have been described as "the heart of Russian cuisine."<br><br>
Pelmeni are Russian, filled dumplings that are cooked in broth or salted water. Then the dumplings are served with
vinegar or sour cream. They are ideal for freezing and can therefore also be made in advance.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients for 4 people:</h2>
    
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Flour</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>250ml Water</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>500 g minced beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g minced beef</li>
        <li>30 ml of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For cooking:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 liters of broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>400 g sour cream</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Knead the flour, eggs, water and salt into a smooth, soft dough. Add enough water to make the dough nice and smooth.
        Wrap the dough up and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the minced meat with the cream, the finely diced onion and garlic clove, the salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 portions and roll it out thinly, either on the rolling mat or with the pasta roller.</li>
        <li>Use a cookie cutter or glass to cut out about 5-6 cm circles and cover them with a marble-sized piece of minced meat
        filling. Close the circle to a semicircle - if the edge of the dough does not stick, you can easily moisten it with
        water. Now glue the two ends together so that the typical pelmeni shape is created.</li>
        <li>You can freeze the pelmeni on a baking sheet and then, as soon as they are frozen, store them airtight in the freezer in
        bags or bowls.
        </li>
        <li>Boil 3 liters of salted water or vegetable stock and add the bay leaves. Add the pelmeni to the water and cook them in
        it for about 4-5 minutes until they float to the surface.
        </li>
        <li>After cooking, toss the pelmeni in melted butter and serve them with the sour cream and chives.</li>
    </ol>
